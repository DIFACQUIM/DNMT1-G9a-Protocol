# *De novo*-inspired selection of compounds

Two datasets were used as training sets for alvaBuilder: "active" compounds against DNMT1 in "ChEMBL31_DNMT1_10micM_285_Curated.csv" and a diverse library from Life Chemicals in "LifeChemicals_DiversityPS6_Random_285.csv". The dataset of the 1398 *de novo* compounds are in the file "alvaBuilder_1398_Curated.csv".
